    "As stated by Chicago White Sox General Manager Rick Hahn, “You don’t want to be a club that’s not good enough [to win] a championship but at the same time is just stuck in the middle” (Sheinin). As a result, teams in professional sports, namely the NBA, often lose games on purpose, or \"tank\", in order to secure a higher draft pick. With the higher draft pick, teams have a better selection regarding who they want to draft and often end up with a better player relative to a lower draft selection (Kram). The thought process here is that a better player will make the team better, driving them “over the hump” of a mediocre record into championship contention. This paper dives into the monetary and gameplay implications of tanking in the NFL.\n",
